# libft

In this first project of the 42 cursus, we had to rewrite some functions in order to create our own library "libft.a".

The first part is about recoding functions from the libc library.\
The second part concerns additional functions that will be useful for the following projects.\
The third (optional) part is a bonus on the subject of linked lists.

Result: 125 % thanks to the bonuses.
